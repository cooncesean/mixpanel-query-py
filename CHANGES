* 0.1.9
    * Adds support for both of Mixpanel's authentication schemes:
        - Signature auth ("deprecated", but still supported).
        - Secret auth ("newer" and considered more secure).
    * This change allows the user to specify the use of the newer authentication
      scheme during MixpanelQueryClient instantiation. If the authentication
      scheme is not specified, the library defaults to the older, signature
      based scheme.

    * Updates 'get_export' functionality to bring it inline with mixpanel's current API
* 0.1.7
    * Adds support for customizing the timeout time of the client's connections.
